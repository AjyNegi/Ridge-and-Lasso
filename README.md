## Conclusions
- GrLivArea is most significant variable.
- 1000 is optimal value of alpha in ridge regression model
- 2500 is optimal value of alpha in lasso regression model
- Lasso regression has standard deviation of 0.57 which is way higher hence ridge model is the correct choice as it has standard deviation of 0.097
